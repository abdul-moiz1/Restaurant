Enhance my existing React + Firebase restaurant app “Gourmet Haven”.

🎯 Goals:
1️⃣ Improve the **Owner Dashboard** UI.
2️⃣ Add full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for menu items.
3️⃣ Enhance design aesthetics and usability with TailwindCSS.

────────────────────────────
📦 Requirements:

- Update `OwnerDashboard.jsx`:
  - Show a summary section (Total Dishes, Available, Unavailable).
  - Add an elegant “Add Dish” button that opens a modal (using Tailwind/Headless UI) with the form fields:
    • Dish Name
    • Description
    • Price
    • Image URL (preview when typed)
    • Tags (comma-separated, e.g. "Vegan,Spicy")
    • Availability (checkbox)
  - Allow editing and deleting existing dishes directly from the list.
  - Each dish card should display:
    - Dish Image
    - Name
    - Description
    - Price
    - Tags (as rounded gold badges)
    - Availability status
    - Edit and Delete icons

- Firestore integration (in `/src/firebase.js`):
  - Menu collection: `menu`
  - Each dish document:  
    ```
    {
      name: string,
      description: string,
      price: number,
      imageUrl: string,
      tags: array,
      available: boolean,
      ownerId: string,
      createdAt: serverTimestamp()
    }
    ```
  - Load only dishes created by the logged-in owner.

- Add `DishFormModal.jsx` (new component):
  - Controlled form for adding/editing dishes.
  - Reusable for both new and existing items.
  - Submit button should add or update the dish in Firestore.

🎨 Design Enhancements:

- Color palette:
  - Background: `#f8f7f3`
  - Accent gold: `#c9a348`
  - Cards: white with subtle shadow (`shadow-md`)
- Typography:
  - Headings → Playfair Display
  - Text → Inter or Poppins
- Components:
  - Add smooth transitions on hover for cards and buttons.
  - Show dish image in a rounded container.
  - “Your Menu” section in a 3-column responsive grid.
- Add a top header bar with app name and Logout button (already present, keep consistent style).

────────────────────────────
🧠 Functional Flow:

1. When the owner clicks “Add Dish” → open modal.
2. Submit → save dish data in Firestore.
3. Fetch dishes in real time from Firestore using `onSnapshot`.
4. Allow inline delete confirmation.
5. Display counts dynamically (Total, Available, Unavailable).

💡 Bonus:
- Include placeholder dish images if no image URL is provided.
- Add subtle animation (Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions) when dishes appear.
