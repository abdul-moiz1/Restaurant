1. UI/UX Enhancements

Keep using Tailwind CSS for styling.

Add a premium golden logo with subtle shimmer animation in the navbar.

Improve home page hero section:

Full-screen restaurant background.

Dark gradient overlay.

Headline: “Welcome to Gourmet Haven 🍽️”

Subtext: “Experience Fine Dining at Home”

Button: “View Menu”

Smooth fade-in animations for text and buttons.

Add hover zoom effect to the background image.

In navbar:

If user not logged in → show Login / Sign Up

If user logged in → show Logout and hide Login button.

Add a footer:

Gold-accent background with subtle gradient.

Animated icons (plates, cups, utensils) using Tailwind keyframes.

Contact info (email, phone, address).

Add “© 2025 Gourmet Haven” at the bottom.

🍽️ 2. Menu Page Fix & Improvements

Menu page should load for everyone (even without login).

Fetch menu items from Firestore (menu collection).

Add sample menu items automatically if collection is empty:

Grilled Salmon — $25 — “Fresh Atlantic salmon with lemon butter sauce”

Truffle Pasta — $18 — “Creamy pasta with white truffle oil”

Caesar Salad — $10 — “Crisp romaine with parmesan and dressing”

Chocolate Lava Cake — $12 — “Rich molten chocolate dessert”

Each dish card:

Image, title, price, description.

“Add to Cart” button for customers.

Hover lift animation (hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-xl).

Responsive layout: grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6.

🎛️ 3. Filters / Preferences (on Menu Page)

Move filters to the top of Menu page (not separate page).

Add a horizontal FilterBar above the menu:

Dropdown: Cuisine Type (e.g., Italian, Asian, Desserts)

Checkboxes: Vegan, Keto, Gluten-Free

Slider: Price Range

“Apply Filters” button with gold gradient hover.

Filters update menu in real time (client-side filtering is fine).

Style filter bar with glassy background (backdrop-blur-lg bg-white/20).

🧍‍♂️ 4. Customer Page Fix

When a customer logs in, redirect them to the Menu page.

Show their name on navbar: “Welcome, [Name]”.

Hide login/signup buttons when logged in.

Make sure customer login page doesn’t stay blank — if blank, redirect to /menu.

Only require login when they try to checkout (not for browsing or filtering).

🧑‍🍳 5. Owner Dashboard

Owner gets redirected to /dashboard after login.

Dashboard shows:

Stats: Total Dishes, Available, Out of Stock.

Table of menu items with edit/delete buttons.

“Add Dish” button → modal with form (Name, Price, Description, Image).

Store dishes in Firestore under menu collection.

Update real-time when items are added/edited/deleted.

🔐 6. Firebase Integration

Ensure Firebase Auth + Firestore are properly configured.

Schema:

users/{uid}: {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: "customer" | "owner";
}

menu/{id}: {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  available: boolean;
  cuisineType: string;
  dietary: string[];
}


When user signs up:

Ask “Are you a Customer or Owner?”

Store role in users collection.

🎨 7. Animations & Tailwind Additions

Add these keyframes to tailwind.config.js:

extend: {
  keyframes: {
    shimmer: {
      '0%': { backgroundPosition: '-200% 0' },
      '100%': { backgroundPosition: '200% 0' },
    },
  },
  animation: {
    shimmer: 'shimmer 3s infinite linear',
  },
}


Apply shimmer to logo and footer icons.

Smooth transitions across buttons and modals.

🧾 8. Final Behavior Summary

Menu is public.

Filters live at top of Menu.

Customers redirected to Menu after login.

Owners redirected to Dashboard after login.

Add sample dishes on first load.

Improved animations, fonts, and layout using Tailwind.

✅ Prompt Goal:
Upgrade my existing React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Firebase restaurant app to a fully functional, premium-looking experience with working authentication redirections, animated UI, sample menu items, and a fixed customer login flow — without rebuilding from scratch.
