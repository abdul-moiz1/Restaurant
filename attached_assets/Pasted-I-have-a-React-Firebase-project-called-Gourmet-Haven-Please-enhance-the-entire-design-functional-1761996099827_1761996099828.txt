I have a React + Firebase project called Gourmet Haven.
Please enhance the entire design, functionality, and Firebase integration with the following requirements:

🎨 1. Home Page Enhancements

Keep a luxurious, fine-dining background (blurred restaurant lights).

Add a premium animated logo (e.g., golden plate/fork icon that subtly glows or rotates).

Animate the headline text (“Elevate Your Dining Experience”) with a fade-up animation.

Replace the “Sign Up” and “Login” navbar buttons with a single “Login” button visible only when not logged in.

Add Preferences below the hero (remove it from the navbar):

Cuisine filters (Italian, Indian, Continental, etc.)

Dietary filters (Vegan, Keto, Gluten-Free)

Price range slider

“Apply Filters” button that updates the menu dynamically.

On hover, hero image slightly zooms or uses parallax motion.

🍽️ 2. Menu Page & Item Management

Populate with real-looking sample dishes (e.g., Steak, Pasta, Salad, Dessert, Sushi, Soup).

Each dish card must show:

Image

Dish name

Price

Availability (Available / Out of Stock)

“Add to Cart” button (for customers)

Add hover animation: slight scale-up with a shadow glow.

Add dynamic filtering via Preferences from Home.

When no dish matches, show a graceful message:
“No dishes match your preferences — try a different flavor!”

👨‍🍳 3. Owner Dashboard (Add / Edit / Delete Dishes)

Add an Owner Dashboard page accessible only to users with role = "owner".

Include:

+ Add Dish button → opens modal with:

Dish Name

Price

Description

Availability toggle

Image upload (to Firebase Storage)

Owner can:

Add new dishes (saved in Firestore under /menu collection).

Edit or Delete existing dishes.

Publish or unpublish dishes.

Dashboard shows:

Total Dishes

Available / Unavailable counts

Preview of dishes in a responsive grid.

🧍 4. Customer Experience

Customers can:

Browse menu and filter preferences without logging in.

Log in only when they click “Checkout”.

Add dishes to cart (stored temporarily in local state or Firestore).

After login, continue checkout seamlessly.

On login, “Sign Up” and “Login” buttons disappear and show “Cart” + “Logout”.

🔐 5. Login Flow & Role Selection

When clicking “Login,” show a modal:

“Are you a Customer or Owner?”

Two styled buttons → redirect to respective Firebase auth flow.

Firebase Auth:

Email/Password login and signup.

Google Sign-In support.

Store user roles in Firestore (users/{uid}.role = "customer" | "owner").

Owners see Dashboard after login; customers go to the menu.

🧾 6. Footer Design

Add elegant footer background (cream or gold tone).

Include animated plates, forks, and glasses moving softly with CSS.

Add:

📍 Address

📞 Phone

📧 Email

Links: About • Contact • Privacy Policy

Small text animation (like shimmer on hover).

💅 7. Style & UX

Use TailwindCSS for styling.

Palette:

Gold #D4AF37

Ivory #FAF7F2

Dark Text #2E2E2E

Smooth transitions with Framer Motion (for page load, modals, buttons).

Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).

⚙️ 8. Firebase Integration

Use:

Firebase Auth (email + Google)

Firestore for menu, users, and roles

Firebase Storage for dish images

Firestore structure:

users/
  uid/
    name:
    email:
    role: "customer" or "owner"

menu/
  dishId/
    name:
    price:
    description:
    imageUrl:
    available: true/false
    createdBy: uid


Secure with Firebase Rules (only owners can write to /menu).
