Enhance and redesign my React + Firebase restaurant app "Gourmet Haven".

🎯 Goal:
Improve the entire app’s design and user experience — including:
- Home page
- Login / Signup flow
- Customer and Owner dashboards
- Menu and preferences pages
while keeping all existing functionality with Firebase Auth and Firestore.

🌐 App Overview

The app has two main roles:
- 👩‍🍳 Owner → Manages dishes in Firestore (CRUD operations)
- 🍽️ Customer → Views menu, filters preferences, and can checkout

────────────────────────────
💫 Design & UI Improvements

**General Theme**
- Minimal, elegant restaurant aesthetic.
- Use TailwindCSS for styling.
- Font: “Playfair Display” for headings, “Poppins” for body.
- Accent gold color `#c9a348`, off-white background `#f8f7f3`.
- Smooth hover transitions and subtle shadows.
- Add fade-in animation (Framer Motion optional) for main sections.

🏠 Home Page Redesign

- Full-width hero banner with a **premium-quality image** (fine dining or elegant dish) and overlay text:
  “Refined global cuisine, curated for your taste.”
- On hover, slightly zoom in the image (smooth parallax effect).
- Add a translucent navbar with:
  - App name/logo on left
  - Buttons on right: **Home**, **Menu**, **Preferences**, **Login**, **Sign up**
- “Sign up” button styled in gold with rounded corners.
- Below hero: show 3 sample dishes in a card layout (same style as menu).
- Include “Explore Menu” button that scrolls down smoothly to the menu section.

────────────────────────────
🔐 Authentication (Firebase Auth)

Improve login/signup functionality:
- Use Firebase Authentication (email/password and Google login).
- Add attractive login/signup modal instead of redirect page.
- On login:
  - If user has `role: "owner"` → redirect to `/owner-dashboard`
  - If user has `role: "customer"` → redirect to `/menu`
- On signup:
  - Ask for account type (Customer or Owner) — like a card selector.
  - Save user info in Firestore `users` collection:
    ```
    {
      uid: string,
      email: string,
      displayName: string,
      role: "customer" | "owner",
      createdAt: serverTimestamp()
    }
    ```
- Show friendly validation messages and loading indicators.
- Add “Forgot Password?” flow using Firebase `sendPasswordResetEmail`.

────────────────────────────
👥 Customer Experience

- Customers can access **menu** and **preferences** without login.
- Only require login for **checkout**.
- Add “Preferences” page with filters:
  - Dietary type dropdown (Vegan, Vegetarian, etc.)
  - Allergens toggle (Gluten, Dairy, Nuts)
  - Spice level slider
- Menu page:
  - Show dishes as elegant cards with image, description, price, and tags.
  - Add live search bar at top.
  - Allow filter by preferences (client-side filtering).
  - Add subtle hover lift effect and price highlight in gold.

────────────────────────────
📊 Owner Dashboard (Enhance UI)

- Keep existing CRUD functions.
- Add 3 metric cards at top:
  - Total Dishes
  - Available
  - Unavailable
- Dishes displayed in responsive 3-column grid.
- Each card: larger image, tags, availability toggle, edit/delete buttons.
- “Add Dish” opens a modern modal with inputs for:
  - Name, Description, Price, Tags, Image URL, Available toggle.
- Use Firestore to store and sync data in real-time.
- Add confirmation before delete.
- Include loading spinner while fetching data.

────────────────────────────
🧭 Navigation Flow

- Public routes: `/`, `/menu`, `/preferences`
- Protected routes:
  - `/checkout` → Customer only
  - `/owner-dashboard` → Owner only
- If unauthorized user tries to access a protected route → show “Access Denied” message.

────────────────────────────
✨ Final Touches

- Add consistent footer with © Gourmet Haven 2025.
- Include meta tags and favicon.
- Make entire app fully responsive (mobile-friendly).
- Add animation to hero text on home load.
- Add toast notifications for actions (login success, dish added, etc.) using `react-hot-toast`.

────────────────────────────
✅ Expected Outcome

A fully refined “Gourmet Haven” app with:
- Polished professional design.
- Smooth Firebase login/signup.
- Role-based navigation.
- Accessible menu and preferences for all users.
- Checkout restricted to authenticated customers.
- Owner dashboard with real-time Firestore data and improved visuals.
